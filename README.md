# Finding Donors for Charity - ML Project

We have a charity organization that supports people financially, and we are helping them do so using machine learning. That's by training a machine learning model that predicts the best candidates for donating, given from previous data that the best donors are the ones with income greater than $50,000 per year.

# Steps
First: We analyzed the previous data related to the charity organization.
Second: We prepared the data in a way to make it appropriate for the model to train on.
Third: Model Training. We tried a couple of algorithms or classifiers.
Forth: Compared the models through different metrics measures like Accuracy and the F-Score.
Fifth: Analyzed the results.
Last: According to our analysis or conclusion we chose the best model for training and optimized its parameters for retraining and prediction.

All the steps are available in the Jupiter notebook provided.
